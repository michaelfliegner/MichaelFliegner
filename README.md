Mein neues - altes - Steckenpferd in der Ruhe der Rente neu betrachtet: Revisionsf√§hige Historisierung "auf dem Bierdeckel"

Audit proof temporal data storage has "haunted" me for 30 years since I first rescued a project struggling with it. Though it is not really a hard problem, I encountered many misconceptions on it, even under qualified software engineers. My first year as a pensionist made me wish for a simple and elegant solution which - under the regime of maximizing lines of codes - I never had time and patience to develop. 

Now I had - and then I also learnt, that open source development culture is far ahead that of average business development. Github, Gitpod and Julia are impressive examples in my eyes.

Another takeaway was the power of mathematical notation. While my model may look trivial to the mathematically educated, I think, its simplicity could have spared me and others some time and hassle in the days.

Here we have a fully operational lightweight generic solution to enabling open source bitemporal data management.

Comments welcome!
